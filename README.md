# AI-for-Chemical-Engineers

## TL;DR
This is a practical course designed for chemical engineers that want to learn the basics of AI. The course is very practical and will cover various topics, such as basic Python syntax, solving ODEs, data visualization, machine learning and deep learning models, natural language processing, image processing and explainability.

## Introduction
This course covers the following topics: (i) basics of the  Python syntax, data pre-processing and analysis, (ii) fundamentals in machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, classification and regression techniques, (iii) deep-dives into various sub-fields of artificial intelligence such as natural language processing (NLP), image processing, graph neural networks (GNN) and how they can be applied in chemical engineering, and (iv) explainable artificial intelligence. In this course, several algorithms are introduced and discussed through practical coding tutorials, in order to provide students with a solid knowledge on how to implement various models in different frameworks, such as scikit-learn, PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
The course is composed by 7 weeks and is designed to be comprehensive and self-paced. 

## Why Python?
Python is one of the most popular languages in use today, thanks to its easy syntax, readability, libraries available and broad documentation. It is open-source, unlike other very popular programs such as MATLAB, which require a license. It has a big community, meaning that other people have probably already asked any possible question you might be having right now. Some forums where to ask and look for questions: StackOverflow (for practical questions about code), StackExchange (for more theoretical questions). It is the to-go language for data analysis and data science, both in academia and industry.
