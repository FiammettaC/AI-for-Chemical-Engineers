# AI-for-Chemical-Engineers

## TL;DR
This is a practical course designed for chemical engineers that want to learn the basics of AI. The course is very practical and will cover various topics, such as basic Python syntax, solving ODEs, data visualization, machine learning and deep learning models, natural language processing, image processing and explainability.

## Introduction
the first two weeks of the course are shared among the courses in the sPyCE series and are introductory. 
From week 3, this course dives into various AI methods. The aim of this course is to provide multiple use cases of how machine learning, natural language processing, and image processing can be applied in various chemical engineering applications. 
The course is composed by 7 weeks and is designed to be comprehensive and self-paced. 

## Why Python?
Python is one of the most popular languages in use today, thanks to its easy syntax, readability, libraries available and broad documentation. It is open-source, unlike other very popular programs such as MATLAB, which require a license. It has a big community, meaning that other people have probably already asked any possible question you might be having right now. Some forums where to ask and look for questions: StackOverflow (for practical questions about code), StackExchange (for more theoretical questions). It is the to-go language for data analysis and data science, both in academia and industry.
