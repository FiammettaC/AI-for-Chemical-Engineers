    "- **Supervised and unsupervised learning**.\n",
    "- **Classification and regression techniques**.\n",

    "- **SUPERVISED LEARNING**: is a machine learning approach where labeled datasets are available. These datasets are used to train (or supervise) the algorithms for predicting an outcome. The labeled inputs and outputs are therefore used for the model to learn over time, and metrics can be calculated to estimate how accurate the model is. Supervised learning can be further divided into **classification** and **regression** tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **UNSUPERVISED LEARNING**: is a machine learning approach that uses algorithms to analyze or cluster unlabeled data. The algorithms are used to discover patterns in the data, without the need for human labeling (and are therefore \"unsupervised\"). "
